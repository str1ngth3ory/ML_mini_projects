# Machine Learning - Understanding the Algorithms
The objective of this repo is to explore various Machine Learning algorithms and their empirical behavior. Techniques investigated are as follows:

1. Supervised Learning
    - Decision Tree
    - Ensemble Learning (Boosted Decision Tree )
    - K Nearest Neighbors
    - Neural Networks
    - Support Vector Machine
2. Random Search
    - Randomized Hill Climbing
    - Simulated Annealing
    - Genetic Algorithm
    - MIMIC
3. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) and Dimension Reduction
    - kNN and Gaussian Mixture Model
    - Dimension Reduction
      - PCA
      - ICA
      - RP
      - Manifold Learning - Isomap
4. Markov Decision Process and Reinforced Learning
    - Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
    - Q-Learning

## Prerequisites
The following library are required:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- bettermdptools
- mlrose-hiive

And Jupyter Notebook is required.
