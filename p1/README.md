## CS 7641 Assignment 1: Supervised Learning
The objective of this assignment is to explore various Supervised Learning algorithms and their empirical behavior when applied to two distinct datasets: the Apple Quality and the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) datasets. By analyzing the performance of five Supervised Learning algorithms on these datasets, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and limitations. The five algorithms to be analyzed are as follows:
    - Decision Tree
    - Ensemble Learning (Boosted Decision Tree )
    - K Nearest Neighbors
    - Neural Networks
    - Support Vector Machine

## Dataset Information
    - Apple Quality (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/apple-quality)
    - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)

## Prerequisites
The following library are required:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
    - plotly

And Jupyter Notebook is required.

## How to run
1. Open the corresponding .ipnyb file with Jupyter Notebook.
    - apple.ipynb
    - breast_cancer.ipynb
2. Download the dataset from the above links, and set the path to the dataset by editing the second cell in the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Run every cell sequentially execpt the cell that commented as \#\#\# SKIP \#\#\#

For information, the notebook file is written in Sections as follows:
1. Load Data
2. Statistics
3. Preprocessing
4. Decision Tree
5. Boosting
6. K Nearest Neighbors
7. Neural Network
8. Support Vector Machine
